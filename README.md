#### Deadline Policy

This program is project-based, and each project has a suggested deadline to keep students on pace towards graduation. In addition to the suggested project deadlines, each class has a **term end deadline**, by which date all required projects must be passed in order to successfully complete the course and receive a certificate.

**Suggested Project Deadlines by Class**

#### Deadlines FAQ

**What is a “suggested deadline”?**

The “suggested deadlines” are flexible deadlines that are meant to guide students towards graduation and there’s no penalty if you miss the project deadlines we’ve laid out for you. You are welcome to turn in your projects before or after the suggested deadline as long as you turn everything in by the **term end date**.

**Do I have to turn my projects in by the dates Udacity has laid out?**

No. The project deadline dates we’ve laid out are suggestions from our team to help keep you on pace to successfully graduate by the end of the Nanodegree term. The date that you should use as your compass is the **term end deadline**.

**What happens if I don’t complete a project by the date Udacity has laid out?**

Nothing. **There is no penalty for missing a suggested project deadline and you can turn projects in at any time (before or after the suggested deadline), as long as it is by your term end deadline**. Although the project deadlines you see are soft deadlines, we highly recommend you try your best to keep up with the suggested deadlines to ensure you can get through the content at a reasonable pace and so all your projects don’t pile up a few weeks before your **term-end deadline**.

**What do I need to do in order to complete the course?**

Students must complete and pass all the required projects by the **term-end date** in order to successfully graduate from the program. Passing a project means that a Udacity Reviewer has marked your project as “Meets Specifications.” The project review process can take anywhere between a couple of hours to a couple of days, so please plan accordingly as you turn in your projects towards the end of your term. Your projects must be reviewed and passed by the last day of the term. NOTE: you can submit your project as many times as you need to in order to pass.

**Can I graduate from the Nanodegree program without completing and passing all the required projects?**

No, all required projects must be completed and passed in order to receive a Nandodegree certificate. However, the course may have a few extra projects or labs (those not mentioned in the Deadlines calendar), which are solely for your benefit and are not required for graduation.

**Do I need to wait until the last day of the term in order to graduate?**

No. Students can graduate from the program at anytime after they complete and pass all the required projects. Once your final project has been passed by a Udacity Reviewer, you will see the option to begin the graduation process.

**Is the term end date also a suggested deadline?**

**No**. That is the date you should be working towards as the last date you can turn projects in.

**What happens if I don’t turn all my project in by the term end date?**

If you do not pass all projects by the last day of the term, you will receive an **automatic and free 4-week extension (no need to write in to support to receive this extension)** to complete any outstanding projects. You will only receive this extension once, so please do not aim to use this extension unless you absolutely need to and certainly do not leave a majority of your projects unattempted until this extension period.

**Do I need to write in to support to get an extension, should I need it?**

No. You will automatically receive a free 4-week extension if you don’t complete and pass all the required projects by the **term end date**.

**What are my options if I still don’t complete all the required projects within the 4-week extension?**

If you do not complete the term within the extension period, you will be removed from the program and will no longer be able to access course content. To resume access to the course, you would need to re-enroll in a new term and pay the associated enrollment fees again. However, your course progress will carry over to the new term, so you will be able to continue where you left off.

## Communication Guidelines

Your experience in the Nanodegree program and community should be an engaging, fulfilling, and positive one. As such, we have outlined the following system for reporting behavior that does not live up to Udacity’s standards, so it can quickly be addressed by our staff.

All reports of suspected violations to the TOU, Community Code of Conduct or Honor Code should be submitted to report@udacity.com and will be reviewed. If you witness or are experiencing any violations of our policies please get in touch with us. Below prohibited actions as set forth on our Community Code of Conduct:

- **Harassment:** Inappropriate, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or violent comments or conduct.

- **Discrimination:** Offensive comments related to gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability or disease

- **Distributing inappropriate content:** Use of sexual, violent, graphic, or derogatory images

- **Bullying:** Deliberate intimidation, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person

- **Sexual harassment:** Unwelcome sexual attention

- **Defamation:** Obscene, fraudulent, indecent, or libelous acts that defame, abuse, harass, discriminate against or threaten others

- **Plagiarism:** will not cheat on any homework assignment, projects or exams for the Online Courses and, specifically, will not plagiarize materials created by others

- **Self-injury or Suicide:** We do not encourage community postings in Study Groups or Knowledge related to self-injury or suicide. If you or someone you know is exhibiting signs of self-injury or suicide, find help at the Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the U.S. and Befrienders.org globally.
When a potential violation is brought to our attention, we will make every effort to investigate the case thoroughly and make a decision that is fair to all parties.

Thank you, The Udacity Team

### 1.2.- Udacity Support

There are several ways in which you will receive support during the program from Udacity's network of Reviewers, as well as your fellow students.

**Project Reviews**

For any projects you submit, you will receive detailed feedback from a project Reviewer.

These reviews are meant to give you personalized code feedback and to tell you what can be improved in your code (if anything)! This feedback is very like the feedback you would receive working on a small team of engineers. Sometimes, a reviewer might ask you to resubmit a project to meet specifications. In that case, an indication of needed changes will also be provided. Note that you can submit a project as many times as needed to pass.

This feedback is especially useful when building artificially intelligent agents. Sometimes your agents don't always behave as expected -- see the untrained soccer agents below for an example! Your project Reviewer is available to help you figure out how you can change your code, to help your agents master their tasks!


**Knowledge**

To ask questions and get answers from Udacity staff and your peers, we have the Knowledge platform. If you have ever used StackOverflow, this platform is similar. You can post new questions here, add answers or conversational comments, and **upvote** questions and answers. You can also **search** for existing answers and filter by Nanodegree program and project. Knowledge is accessible from the classroom as a lightbulb icon that you'll see at the bottom left of your navigation bar.

https://knowledge.udacity.com/?nanodegree=af1412cc-594c-11e8-aa9f-1fd58b4f9291

**Feedback**

In order to keep our content up-to-date and address issues quickly, we've set up a **Waffle board** to track error reports and suggestions.

https://waffle.io/udacity/nlpnd-waffle-issues

If you find an error, check there to see if it has already been filed. If it hasn't, you can file an issue by clicking on the "Add issue" button, adding a title, and entering a description in the details (you will need a GitHub account for this). Links and screenshots, if available, are always appreciated!
