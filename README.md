#### Deadlines FAQ

**What is a “suggested deadline”?**

The “suggested deadlines” are flexible deadlines that are meant to guide students towards graduation and there’s no penalty if you miss the project deadlines we’ve laid out for you. You are welcome to turn in your projects before or after the suggested deadline as long as you turn everything in by the **term end date**.

**Do I have to turn my projects in by the dates Udacity has laid out?**

No. The project deadline dates we’ve laid out are suggestions from our team to help keep you on pace to successfully graduate by the end of the Nanodegree term. The date that you should use as your compass is the **term end deadline**.

**What happens if I don’t complete a project by the date Udacity has laid out?**

Nothing. **There is no penalty for missing a suggested project deadline and you can turn projects in at any time (before or after the suggested deadline), as long as it is by your term end deadline**. Although the project deadlines you see are soft deadlines, we highly recommend you try your best to keep up with the suggested deadlines to ensure you can get through the content at a reasonable pace and so all your projects don’t pile up a few weeks before your **term-end deadline**.

**What do I need to do in order to complete the course?**

Students must complete and pass all the required projects by the **term-end date** in order to successfully graduate from the program. Passing a project means that a Udacity Reviewer has marked your project as “Meets Specifications.” The project review process can take anywhere between a couple of hours to a couple of days, so please plan accordingly as you turn in your projects towards the end of your term. Your projects must be reviewed and passed by the last day of the term. NOTE: you can submit your project as many times as you need to in order to pass.

**Can I graduate from the Nanodegree program without completing and passing all the required projects?**

No, all required projects must be completed and passed in order to receive a Nandodegree certificate. However, the course may have a few extra projects or labs (those not mentioned in the Deadlines calendar), which are solely for your benefit and are not required for graduation.

**Do I need to wait until the last day of the term in order to graduate?**

No. Students can graduate from the program at anytime after they complete and pass all the required projects. Once your final project has been passed by a Udacity Reviewer, you will see the option to begin the graduation process.

**Is the term end date also a suggested deadline?**

**No**. That is the date you should be working towards as the last date you can turn projects in.

**What happens if I don’t turn all my project in by the term end date?**

If you do not pass all projects by the last day of the term, you will receive an **automatic and free 4-week extension (no need to write in to support to receive this extension)** to complete any outstanding projects. You will only receive this extension once, so please do not aim to use this extension unless you absolutely need to and certainly do not leave a majority of your projects unattempted until this extension period.

**Do I need to write in to support to get an extension, should I need it?**

No. You will automatically receive a free 4-week extension if you don’t complete and pass all the required projects by the **term end date**.

**What are my options if I still don’t complete all the required projects within the 4-week extension?**

If you do not complete the term within the extension period, you will be removed from the program and will no longer be able to access course content. To resume access to the course, you would need to re-enroll in a new term and pay the associated enrollment fees again. However, your course progress will carry over to the new term, so you will be able to continue where you left off.

### 1.2.- Udacity Support

There are several ways in which you will receive support during the program from Udacity's network of Reviewers, as well as your fellow students.

**Project Reviews**

For any projects you submit, you will receive detailed feedback from a project Reviewer.

These reviews are meant to give you personalized code feedback and to tell you what can be improved in your code (if anything)! This feedback is very like the feedback you would receive working on a small team of engineers. Sometimes, a reviewer might ask you to resubmit a project to meet specifications. In that case, an indication of needed changes will also be provided. Note that you can submit a project as many times as needed to pass.

This feedback is especially useful when building artificially intelligent agents. Sometimes your agents don't always behave as expected -- see the untrained soccer agents below for an example! Your project Reviewer is available to help you figure out how you can change your code, to help your agents master their tasks!


**Knowledge**

To ask questions and get answers from Udacity staff and your peers, we have the Knowledge platform. If you have ever used StackOverflow, this platform is similar. You can post new questions here, add answers or conversational comments, and **upvote** questions and answers. You can also **search** for existing answers and filter by Nanodegree program and project. Knowledge is accessible from the classroom as a lightbulb icon that you'll see at the bottom left of your navigation bar.

https://knowledge.udacity.com/?nanodegree=af1412cc-594c-11e8-aa9f-1fd58b4f9291

**Feedback**

In order to keep our content up-to-date and address issues quickly, we've set up a **Waffle board** to track error reports and suggestions.

https://waffle.io/udacity/nlpnd-waffle-issues

If you find an error, check there to see if it has already been filed. If it hasn't, you can file an issue by clicking on the "Add issue" button, adding a title, and entering a description in the details (you will need a GitHub account for this). Links and screenshots, if available, are always appreciated!

### 1.3.- Intro to NLP

#### Introducing Arpan

Our first section will be taught by Arpan Chakraborty. Arpan has a Ph.D. in Computer Science and for several years, has taught at Udacity and at Georgia Tech.

Everything in NLP starts with raw text typically, produced by humans.
This text is first processed using some simple transformations such as:

- Splitting it into individual words

- Reducing verbs to their root form

You need to do this before performing any other analysis or training complex models.
This stage may sound simple but you have to be careful about how you process your raw text, it may affect the results you obtain further down the line.

#### NLP Overview

Language is an important medium for human communication; it allows us to convey information, express our ideas, and give instructions to others

Some philosophers argue that it enables us to form complex thoughts and reason about them; it may turn to be critical component of human intelligence

Now consider the various artificial systems we interact with every day:
- phones
- cars
- websites
- coffee machines

It's natural to expect them to be able to process and understand human language, right?
Yet, computers are still lagging behind. No doubt, we have made some incredible progress in the field of Natural Language Processing; but there is still a long way to go. And that's what makes this an exciting and dynamic area of study

In this lesson you will not only get to know more about the applications and challenges in NLP
You will learn how to design an intelligent application that uses NLP techniques and deploy it on a scalable platform

#### Structured Languages

What makes it so hard for computers to understand us?

One drawback of human languages, or feature depending on how you look at it, is the lack of a precisely defined structure

To understand how that makes things difficult let's take a look at some languages that are more structured. 
Mathematics, for instance, uses a structured language. When I write `y = 2x + 5` there is no ambiguity in what I want to convey. I'm saying that the variable `y` is related to the variable `x` as two times `x` plus five

Formal logic also uses a structure language.
For example, consider the expression `Parent(X, Y) ^ Parent(X, Z) -> Sibling(Y, Z)`
This statement is asserting that if `X` is parent of `Y` and `X` is parent of `Z` then `Y` and `Z` are siblings

A set of structure languages that may be more familiar to you are scripting and programming languages.
Consider this SQL statement

```SQL
SELECT name, emaul
FROM users
WHERE name LIKE 'A%' 
```

We are asking the database to return the names and e-mail addresses of all users whose names begin with an A.
These languages are designed to be as unambiguous as possible and are suitable for computers to process.

#### Grammar

Structured languages are easy to parse and understand for computer because they are defined by a strict set of rules or grammar.
There are standard forms of expressing such grammars and algorithms that can parse properly formed statements to understand exactly what is meant.

When a statement doesn't match the prescribed grammar, a typical computer doesn't try to guess the meaning; it simply gives up
Such violations of grammatical rules are reported as syntax errors

```
>>> say hello
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**QUIZ QUESTION**

Here is a grammar, specified in a simple notation known as **Backus-Naur Form** or BNF [1]:

```
_S_ → 0 _S_ 0
_S_ → 1 _S_ 1
_S_ → 00
_S_ → 11
```

Which of the following sentences are valid according to this grammar?

[1] For a quick review, check out this brief segment on grammars from our Intro to Computer Science course.

https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101/lessons/48299949/concepts/487192400923

**Grammar**

So in order to learn about programming, we need to learn new language. This will be a way to describe what we want the computer to do in a much more precise way than we could in a natural language like English. And it's a way to describe programs that the Python interpreter can run.

One of the best ways to learn a programming language is to just try things.
You can try that in the Python interpreter that's running in your browser.
Let's, for example, try running 

```
2 + 2 +
```

In English, someone could probably guess that the value of `2 + 2 +` should be 4.

In Python, when we try running this, we get an error. And the reason we get an error is that this is not actually part of the Python language. The Python interpreter only knows how to evaluate code that's part of the Python language.
If you try to evaluate something that's not part of the Python language, it will give you and error.

Errors look a bit scary, the way they print out. But there's nothing bad that can happen. It's perfectly okay to try running code. If it produces an error, that's one of the ways to learn about programming.

The error we got here is what's called a `syntax error`. That means that what we tried to evaluate is not actually part of the Python language.

Like English, Python has a grammar that defines what strings are in the language.
In English, we can make lots of sentences that are not completely grammatical, and people still understand them, but there's some underlying grammar behind the language. 

Those of you who are native English speakers, might have learned rules like this in what was once called grammar school. 
Those of you who learned English as a second language, probably learned rules like this when you were learning English

So, English has a rule that says you can make a sentence, by combining a subject with a verb, followed by an object:

Almost every language has a rule sort of like this.
The order of the subject and the verb and the object might be different, but there's a way to combine those three things to form a sentence.

The subject could be a noun.
The object could be a noun.
And then each of these **parts of speech**
Well, we have lots of things they could be.

So a verb could be the word eat.
A verb could also be the word like, and there are lots of other words that the verb could be.

A noun could be the word Python, a noun could be the word cookies.

The actual English grammar is of course, much larger and more complex than this.
But we can still think of it as having rules like this that allow us to form sentences from the parts of speech that we know, from the words that make those parts of speech.

The way we're writing grammars here is a notation called **Backus-Naur Form**. 
And this was invented by John Backus

So John Backus was the lead designer of the Fortran programming language back in the 1950s at IBM
This was one of the first widely used programming languages.
And the way they described the Fortran language was with lots of examples and text explaining what they meant.
And this is a shot from the actual manual for the first version of Fortran.

This works okay, many programmers were able to understand it and guess correctly what it meant.
But was not nearly precise enough.
And when it came time to design a later language which was the language called ALGOL, it became clear that this informal way of describing languages wasn't precise enough.
And John Backus invented the notation that we're using here to describe languages

```
Sentence  ->  Subject  Verb  Object
Subject   ->  Noun
Object    ->  Noun
Verb      ->  Eat
Verb      ->  Like
Noun      ->  I
Noun      ->  Python
Noun      ->  Cookies
```

**Backus Naur Form**

The purpose of Backus-Naur Form is to be able to precisely describe exactly the language in a way that's very simple and very concise.

So each rule has the form like this where on the left side there's a non-terminal.
Sometimes they're written with brackets around them.

There's an arrow, and then on the right side there's a replacement.
The replacement can be anything, it can be a sequence of non-terminals.ç
Sentence can be replaced with subject followed by verb followed by object.
It can be 1 non-terminal, it can also be a terminal.

What's special about the terminals is they never appear on the left side of a rule-
Once we get a terminal we're done, we're finished; there's nothing else we can replace it with

So all the rules have this form:

```
<Non-terminal> -> replacement
```

We can form a sentence by starting from some non-terminal; usually whichever one is written at the top left, in this case the one I called sentence
And then by following the rules we keep replacing non-terminals with their replacements until we're left with only terminals.

Here's an example starting from sentence using the grammar above.
We can start with sentence.
We only can have 1 rule to choose from where sentence is on the left side, so we're going to replace sentence with subject, verb, object

```
      sentence
         |
subject verb object
```

Now we have a lot of choices.
We can pick any of the non-terminals we have left.
Find a rule where that non-terminals is on the left side.

We can pick any of the rules where it's on the left side and do the replacement.
So I'm going to start with the left one. We'll pick subject.
We only only have 1 replacement rule for subject.
We can replace subjet with noun

The others stay like they are, so we still have verb and we still have object.
Now we can keep going

```
subject verb object
   |
 noun   verb object
```

We can pick the first one again.
It's still a non-terminal, so we can still do replacements
With noun we've got 3 choices.
We can pick any one of those choices.

I'm going to pick the first one. We'll replace noun with the terminal I
Now we've got a terminal. We're done with that replacement
Verb and object stay the same

```
noun  verb object
 |
 I
```

As a separate step we're going to find a rule that matches verb.
We have 2 choices. I'll pick the second one and replace verb with like 

```
noun  verb object
 |      |
 I    like
```

We still have object.
Object is a non-terminal, so we have to keep replacing it until we're done.
We have 1 rule for object. We can replace object with noun

```
noun  verb  object
 |      |     |
 I    like   noun
```

Now we have 3 rules for noun. I'm going to pick the second rule and replace noun with Python
What I've done here is what's called a derivation

```
 I    like   noun
              |
            Python
```

A derivation just means starting from some non-terminal, follow the rules to derive a sequence of terminals.
We're done when we have only terminals left and we can derive a sentence in the grammar.
In this case we produced the sentence I like python.
But there are lots of other sentences we could have produced, starting from the same non-terminal if we pick different rules to follow

#### Unstructured Text

The languages we use to communicate with each other also have defined grammatical rules.
And indeed, in some situations we use simple structured sentences, but for the most part human discourse is complex and unstructured.

Despite that, we seem to be really good at understanding each other and even ambiguities are welcome to a certain extent.

So, what can computers do to make sense of unstructured text?
Here are some preliminary ideas:

PROCESS WORDS & PHRASES
- KEYWORDS 
- PARTS OF SPEECH
- NAMED ENTITIES
- DATES & QUANTITIES

PARSE SENTENCES
- STATEMENTS
- QUESTIONS
- INSTRUCTIONS

ANALYZE DOCUMENTS
- FREQUENT & RARE WORDS
- TONE & SENTIMENT
- DOCUMENT CLUSTERING

You can imagine that building on top of these ideas, computers can do a whole lot with unstructured text even if they cannot understand it like us

**QUIZ QUESTION**

Let's see if you can identify parts of speech! Here is a sample English sentence:

```
She works at IBM.
```

For each word in the sentence, label it with the correct part of speech. Here a *named entity* is *essentially* a *proper noun.*

She -> `pronoun`
works -> `verb`
at -> `preposition`
IBM -> `named entity` 

#### Counting Words

Let's implement a simple function that is often used in Natural Language Processing: Counting word frequencies.

Consider this passage of text:

```
As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a ham—plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.
```

*— Excerpt from Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson.*

In the following coding exercise, we have provided code to load the text from a file, call the function `count_words()` to obtain word counts (which you need to implement), and print the 10 most common and least common unique words.

Complete the portions marked as TODO to count how many times each unique word occurs in the text.


`input.txt`

```
As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a ham—plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.
```

`count_words.py`

```python
"""Count words."""

def count_words(text):
    """Count how many times each unique word occurs in text."""
    counts = dict()  # dictionary of { <word>: <count> } pairs to return
    
    # TODO: Convert to lowercase

#### Context Is Everything

So what is stopping computers from becoming as capable as humans in understanding natural language?
Part of the problem lies in the variability and the complexity of our sentences

Consider this excerpt from a movie review

"""
I was lured to see this on the promised of a `smart witty slice of old fashioned fun` and intrigue.
`I was conned`.
"""

Although it starts with some potentially positive words it turns out to be strongly negative review
Sentences like this might be somewhat entertaining for us but computers tend to make mistakes when trying to analyze them

But there is a bigger challenge that makes NLP harder than you think
Take a look at this sentence

"""
The sofa didn't fit through the door because `it` was too narrow
"""

What does `it` refer to?
Clearly `it` refers to the door

Now consider a slight variation of this sentence

"""
The sofa didn't fit through the door because `it` was too `wide`
"""

What does `it` refer to in this case?
Here it's the sofa. Think about it

To understand the proper meaning of `semantics` of the sentence you implicitly applied your knowledge about the physical world 
That wide things don't fit through narrow things

You may have experienced a similar situation before
You can imagine that there are countless other scenarios in which some knowledge or `context` is indispensable for correctly understanding what is being said

```
Contextual Dependence

Can you think of a similar sentence, in English or your own native language, where some contextual or background knowledge is needed to understand the intended meaning?
```

#### NLP and Pipelines

Natural language processing is one of the fastest growing fields in the world
NLP is making its way into a number of products and services that we use every day

Let's begin with an overview of how to design an end-end NLP pipeline

You start with raw text in whatever form it is available, 
process it, 
extract relevant features,
and build models to accomplish various NLP tasks

Now that I think about it,
that is kind of like refining crude oil

Anyways, you'll learn how these different stages in the pipeline depend on each other
You'll also learn how to make design decisions,
how to choose existing libraries,
and tools to perform each step
